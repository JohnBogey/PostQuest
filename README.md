## Welcome to a PostQuest!

PostQuest is a game concept prototype created by Erickson Pascke and Maxwell Lovell, inspired by our love for fun 3D platformers and RPGs!

The idea was to learn unity and try to develop an idea that merges two different game genres.
In traditional RPGs (Role Playing Games), players control an avatar through an emulated world and would have random encounters along their journey to fight monsters.
In our game, instead of encountering these turn based battles, the idea is to place the character into a 3d obstacle course instead.
We wanted to test out how this could be programmed and if the excitement of random platforming challenges could be fun and interesting.

## Usage

In the current prototype, PostQuest is a small experience with:

- ### Overworld
A large island that you can explore, walk around the environment and check out the buildings.
- ### Levels
Randomly as you walk you may be transported into a short level filled with lost mail to collect.
- ### Movement
Fully implemented animations with movement based on the KinematicCharacterController
 - WASD to walk
 - Shift to dive
 - Spacebar to jump
 - Mouse to move camera
