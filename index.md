## Welcome to a PostQuest!

PostQuest is a game created by Erickson Pascke and Maxwell Lovell, inspired by our love for fun 3D platformers!
We decided to create a small experience where players can jump and dive through levels, making their way through the overworld.

## Features

PostQuest is a simple experience but plenty of fun, check out what we have:

- ### Overworld
We have a large island that you can explore, walk around the environment and check out the buildings.
- ### Levels
Randomly as you walk you may be transported into a short level! Complete it to escape, they are designed to be fun to get through and allow room to master it.
- ### Movement
We decided to use Kinematic Character Controller to create smooth and nice feeling controls. Postboy has a wonderful design and animations you can watch as you play!
