## Welcome to a PostQuest!

PostQuest is a game concept prototype created by Erickson Pascke and Maxwell Lovell, inspired by our love for fun 3D platformers and RPGs!

## Features

PostQuest is a simple experience but plenty of fun, check out what we have:

- ### Overworld
We have a large island that you can explore, walk around the environment and check out the buildings.
- ### Levels
Randomly as you walk you may be transported into a short level! Complete it to escape, they are designed to be fun to get through and allow room to master it.
- ### Movement
We decided to use Kinematic Character Controller to create smooth and nice feeling controls. Postboy has a wonderful design and animations you can watch as you play!

## About

The idea was to learn unity and try to develop an idea that merges two different game genres.
In traditional RPGs (Role Playing Games), players control an avatar through an emulated world and would have random encounters along their journey to fight monsters.
In our game, instead of encountering these turn based battles, the idea is to place the character into a 3d obstacle course instead.
We wanted to test out how this could be programmed and if the excitement of random platforming challenges could be fun and interesting.
